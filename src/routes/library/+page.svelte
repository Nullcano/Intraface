      <h3>Intelligent / Adaptive</h3>
      <p>Intraface intelligently adapts and configures elements, classes, and attributes in different scenarios, eliminating the need for manual adjustments and streamlining your design workflow. For instance, if you have a fixed header with a height of 4rem and a fixed sidebar, the sidebar will automatically be pushed down by 4rem from the top when both elements, equipped with the necessary classes and attributes, are present within the body.</p>
