  <h2>Author</h2>
  <p>Hey, I'm just a regular web enthusiast who's been glued to screens since the early 2000s. Web interfaces of all shapes, sizes, and colors have always fascinated me. I've dabbled in building web apps for both fun and work, but I've got a confession to make. I've steered clear of CSS toolkits and frameworks, from the days of Bootstrap to the Tailwind craze we're in now. It's just my quirky preference. I've always had this weird love for writing HTML and CSS from scratch.</p>
  <p>Sure, I've used Tachyons as a "little booster" in the past, but my heart has always belonged to my custom CSS codebase. With Intraface, I'm taking a shot at simplifying your life. My aim? To make sure you don't have to drown in endless custom CSS. I'm introducing nifty shortcuts and clever dynamic solutions to streamline your web development.</p>
  <p>I hope Intraface strikes a chord with both me and folks like you, who are looking to make web development a breeze. Let's take this journey together, and maybe, just maybe, we'll create something awesome!</p>
