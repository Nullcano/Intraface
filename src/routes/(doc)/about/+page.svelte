      <h2>Author</h2>
      <p>I'm a web enthusiast who's been captivated by digital interfaces since the early 2000s. I've always had a soft spot for crafting HTML and CSS from scratch, avoiding popular CSS toolkits and frameworks.</p>
      <p>While I've dabbled with Tachyons in the past, Intraface is my attempt to simplify web development. My aim is to spare you from drowning in endless custom CSS, introducing shortcuts and dynamic solutions to streamline your workflow.</p>
      <p>I hope Intraface resonates with both me and fellow developers seeking a smoother web development journey. Let's embark on this adventure together and maybe, just maybe, create something amazing!</p>

        <strong>Shorthand Classes</strong>
        <p>Say goodbye to writing lengthy combinations of CSS properties. Intraface is introducing shorthand classes that make styling a breeze. For instance, use <code>&lt;div class="stack"&gt;</code>, and it's equivalent to <code>&lt;div class="flex flex-col"&gt;</code>.</p>
      </div>

        <strong>Component Classes</strong>
        <p>Building complex components is about to get a whole lot easier. Intraface will offer specialized classes designed for crafting components without the need for an extensive array of classes in your markup. Just <code>&lt;div class="card"&gt;</code>, and you've got yourself a pre-styled box.</p>

        <strong>Module Bundles</strong>
        <p>No need to load the entire system when you only require specific functionality. Intraface is rolling out module bundles, providing subsets of CSS tailored for specific uses. For instance, load <code>if.colors.min.css</code> to access only the coloring utilities you need.</p>
